Analyze the git changes inside <code></code> tags and provide a report in the format delimited by <format></format> tags.

Additional instructions:
- Be concise.
- Speculative low-priority issues like formatting, @ts-ignore, variable names, non-null assertions etc. should not be included at all, because they are usually intended. If you do find it severe in the given context, include it only in notes.

Additional info about formatting:
- The <format></format> section uses {} (curly braces) to indicate where content should be inserted and to include description, and [] (square brackets) to describe each category. It should not be in the final output.
- The format introduces multiple categories. Each category is OPTIONAL. If you find no issues at all that would belong to a certain category (which is very possible), just include the category and write "No issues found.". All categories should be included.
- Categories should always be written in the same order as in the format.
- In each category can be multiple items. Items should be separated by "---" (three dashes - markdown for a horizontal line, and two newlines before and after it).
- Use markdown formatting. Use code blocks for code snippets, backticks for file names, bold for bullet point titles, and other things that improve readability. It must be very well readable and pretty.
